## To run the server

1. Start your MongoDB server
2. Create a **.env** file under **spa_server** directory with a secret key and mongodb url:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=25BBD370-975D-4D45-8F5A-B3FA92155CCA
MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test
```
3. Start server by hitting <key>**F5**</key> in VS Code or running `dart spa_server/bin/spa_server.dart`
 in your terminal
4. Visit **http://localhost:8080** in the browser and use Postman to perform the other api calls.
